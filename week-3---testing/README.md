# 4003cem-testing
 
## lab_age
Complete the age_description function in the lab_age.h file so that it passes all the unit tests in the Testing/test_age.cpp file.
This will probably be easier if you use the appropriate cmake and test commands.

## lab_vowels
Write a appropriate set of test cases and assertions for the count_vowels() function supplied for you in the lab_vowels.h file.
Some basic tests have been supplied for you in the test_vowels.cpp file.
We are expecting at least 10 assertions.

## lab_tax
Convert your UK tax calculator code from 4000CEM into C++. Function headers have been supplied for you in the lab_tax.h file.
Once you have finished converting your code, write an appropriate series of unit tests in the test_tax.cpp file.
Make sure to check for edge cases.
We are expecting at least 15 assertions.
